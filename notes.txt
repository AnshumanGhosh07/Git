**GIT WORKFLOW**
---------------------
1. **Working Directory** – The place where you create or modify files locally.

2. **Staging Area** – Temporary holding area where you add changes using:

        ```bash
        git add <file_name>
        ```

        ```bash
        git status  :   git status shows the current state of your working 
        ```             directory and staging area

        ```bash
        git rm --cached -r .    :   removes all tracked files from the staging 
        ```                         area but keeps them in your working directory.

3. **Local Repository** – Stores committed changes in your local `.git` database using:

        ```bash
        git commit -m "message"
        ```
4. **Remote Repository** – Stores your code on platforms like GitHub.

        ```bash
        git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
        ```

            * **`-u`** → Sets the default upstream branch, so future pushes can be done with just `git push`.
            * **`<remote name>`** → Usually `origin` (the name of your remote repo).
            * **`<branch name>`** → The branch you want to push (e.g., `main` or `master`).

        **Example:**
            ```bash
            git push -u origin main
            ```

        ```bash
        git checkout <file_name> :  `git checkout chapter3.txt` replaces the file `chapter3.txt` in your 
        ```                         working directory with the version from the last commit (HEAD).
        
            Meaning:
                * Any changes you made to `chapter3.txt` that weren’t committed will be **lost**.
                * It’s a way to **discard local changes** for that file.
        
        ```bash
        git diff chapter3.txt   :   `git diff chapter3.txt` will show the **unstaged changes** 
        ```                         you’ve made to `chapter3.txt` compared to the last committed version.
